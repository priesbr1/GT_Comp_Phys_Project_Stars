# GT_Comp_Phys_Project_Stellar Integration

This is my Computational Physics (PHYS 6260) project for stellar structure integration at Georgia Tech.

Description of files in `scripts/`:
* `boundaries.py` - defines ZAMS boundary conditions
* `derivatives.py` - defines equations of stellar structure
* `integrate.py` - defines RK4 integration
* `plotting.py` - plots outputs
* `stellar.py` - defines main integration and perturbation functions used in program
* `structure.py` - defines the equations of state
* `utils.py` - defines constants and utility functions
* `ZAMS.py` - primary file used to run program
